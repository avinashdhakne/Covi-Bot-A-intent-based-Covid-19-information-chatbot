For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer.

Here are a few suggestions on things that could help you proactively manage your anxiety:TIP 1: DO THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BODY AND MINDYour body and mind are connected. Here are some things you can do to keep them healthy:\\\\u2022 Stay active! Being physically active is good for your body and can help your mind feel better too. If you can go outside, try a walk, run, bike ride, or any other sport. If indoors, try dancing, stretching, or any other movement you can do. Find what works for you \\\\u2013 and do it! \\\\u2022 Eat well! Try to make healthy choices about what you eat if you can.\\\\u2022 Take notice of yourself and the world around you. This means becoming more aware of your breathing, your body and your surroundings. Try to BE PRESENT in the moment! \\\\u2022 Sleep! Try to get the right balance of sleep each night. This will help you grow well, stay healthy, and keep clear thoughts.\\\\u2022\\\\u00a0 Find things that make you happy and do those things more! Listening to music, reading, playing games, chatting with friends, growing plants, cooking, drawing, playing sports\\\\u2026there are many possibilities! Perhaps even try something new! Just make sure that during these activities you respect physical distancing and other protection measures that are in place in your country.TIP 2: STAY CONNECTED TO LOVED ONESKeep in touch with your family and friends however you can. Use social media, email, phone calls, write a letter! Be creative. And if you can\\\\u2019t connect, then think about a memory of a shared time together.TIP 3: RECOGNISE HOW YOU ARE FEELINGUnderstanding how you feel is important. Don\\\\u2019t ignore it. Sometimes writing your feelings down can help you to describe it. It might sound easy or simple, but try this \\\\u201cI feel ....... right now\\\\u201d.TIP 4: BE KIND TO YOURSELF It is okay to feel however it is that you\\\\u2019re feeling. Putting pressure on yourself to always \\\\u2018be happy\\\\u2019 or \\\\u2018stay positive\\\\u2019 or \\\\u2018stay productive\\\\u2019 can sometimes make you feel worse. Instead, if you notice you are experiencing difficult emotions, try telling yourself: \\\\u201cI feel worried and scared, but that does not mean I am not coping.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s been a tough time, it\\\\u2019s okay to be upset.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cI am feeling [insert how you are feeling] and that is okay.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cThese are difficult times, it\\\\u2019s normal to feel upset.\\\\u201d Or think of something to tell yourself that works for you. TIP 5: LISTEN TO YOUR BODYOur body experiences and reacts to how we feel. Do you often get headaches? Do your shoulders, chest, or stomach sometimes feel tense? Try closing your eyes, and listening to your own breathing. Notice how you feel in each part of your body, starting from your head down to your toes. Notice if you are feeling any tightness, pain, or pressure in your body. Being aware of where you are feeling tension can help you release it.TIP 6: TRY USING YOUR BREATH TO CALM YOURSELFSlow breathing is one of the quickest ways of calming down the body when we experience feelings such as fear, worry or anger. Close your eyes and think of a calm place. Imagine yourself there, feeling relaxed.\\\\u2022 Focus on breathing slowly. \\\\u2022 Breathe in for a slow count of 3 and out for a slow count of 3. \\\\u2022 Practice this for a few minutes. How do you feel after?TIP 7: AVOID UNHEALTHY WAYS OF COPING WITH STRESSWhen you are experiencing difficult feelings, it is important to find healthy ways to take care of yourself.Find out more on our\\\\u00a0#HealthyAtHome - Mental health page.

While online solutions provide huge opportunities for continuing your learning, socializing and playing, you should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. This is because you need to be physically active to keep healthy and a positive attitude. In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore, it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities, like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like going for a walk or jog.

WHO defines a contact as a person who has been exposed to someone else who has had recent probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1. face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1  meter and for at least 15 minutes; 2. direct physical contact with a probable  or confirmed case; 3. direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed  COVID-19 disease without the use of recommended PPE; or 4. other situations as  indicated by local risk assessments. Exposure is considered any time between 2 days before to at least 13 days after the case started to show symptoms. For  asymptomatic cases, a contact is anyone who has been exposed between 2 days  before and 10 days after the date on which the sample that led to confirmation  of infection was taken.Identifying contacts: this is usually done through an interview with the person infected with\\\\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 to find out who they have been in contact with\\\\u00a0during the period of time described above.  There are other ways to identify contacts depending on the setting, for  example through membership or attendance lists of places the case visited  during the period described above, or through public notices. Digital  proximity tracing applications have also been developed to help identify and  notify contacts through automated processes. Informing contacts: each identified contact should be contacted to confirm whether they meet the definition of a contact. This  may be done through health authorities and/or via digital tracing proximity  applications. Cases may also be encouraged to  inform their own contacts. Each person\\\\u00a0identified as a contact will be informed about the goal of contact tracing, the process (including how their personal data will be protected), how to undertake quarantine and for how long, and who to contact with any concerns or questions. Additional information should be provided on symptoms to monitor throughout the quarantine period, and what to do if a contact returns  a positive test or becomes unwell.Managing and monitoring contacts: contacts should be encouraged and supported during the \\\\u00a0quarantine period. WHO recommends that the quarantine period ends 14 days after the contact was last exposed to the person who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the duration of the quarantine period may vary between countries.Data processes and analysis: The information collected from each contact is stored in a secure database.

Despite limited data, available information suggests\\\\u00a0current WHO recommended COVID-19 vaccines ( AstraZeneca/Oxford, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BionTech, Sinopharm and Sinovac)\\\\u00a0are safe for people living with HIV. The currently available vaccine products are not live vaccines, they include genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 which cannot replicate. Therefore, these vaccines are not expected to be less safe in people who are immunocompromised. In addition to this, no pharmacological interactions have been reported between COVID-19 vaccines and antiretroviral medications which people living with HIV should continue to take after vaccination to maintain health.Recently, a debate in the scientific literature has led to broader concerns about a potential association observed more than a decade ago between adenovirus vector-based vaccines and an increased risk of acquiring HIV infection among men who received this type of vaccine[1]. This unexpected finding was detected in two HIV vaccine trials that used adenovirus vector containing products[2],[3]. The reason for this observed HIV risk remains uncertain, although several follow-up studies have suggested a possible interference in the HIV specific vaccine response or in the CD4 cell susceptibility to HIV infection induced by this kind of vaccine[4],[5]. However, a third study using another adenovirus vector-based vaccine, conducted more recently has not reported this finding[6]. Specific studies on this topic with COVID-19 vaccines are needed. Despite these potential concerns, it is important to highlight that the benefits of all authorized COVID-19 vaccines in a pandemic context currently outweigh the potential risks.

Therefore, countries can make plans for people to receive the vaccine in order of priority based on their age, health, occupation and other factors such as people in living in care or residential homes, or closed settings such as prisons. Some countries are prioritizing vaccination for all people living with HIV or for those who are immunocompromised (as indicated by having a CD4 cell count <200/mm3)\\\\u00a0[8],[9].\\\\u00a0An informal poll of more than 100 countries from all regions revealed at least 40 that have an immunization policy that prioritizes vaccinations for people living with HIV. These policies are supported by recent literature which suggests that people living with HIV at any CD4 cell count appear to be at increased risk for severe outcomes and death due to COVID-19 compared with people without HIV [10],[11],[12]. Independent of immune status, many people living with HIV have one or more comorbidities that may put them at increased risk for a more severe COVID-19. A new WHO report confirms that HIV infection is a significant independent risk factor for both severe/ critical COVID-19 presentation at hospital admission and in-hospital mortality. Overall, nearly a quarter (23.1%) of all people living with HIV who were hospitalized with COVID-19, died [13]. The report is based on clinical surveillance data from 37 countries regarding the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes in people living with HIV (PLHIV) admitted to hospital for COVID-19. And found that the risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19 was 30% greater in PLHIV compared to people without HIV infection.\\\\u00a0 Underlying conditions such as diabetes and hypertension are common among PLHIV. Among male PLHIV over the age of 65 years, diabetes and hypertension were associated with an increased risk of more severe and fatal COVID-19. These conditions are known to put people at increased risk of severe disease and death [13].Therefore, all people living with HIV should be prioritized for early vaccination. And people living with HIV with co-morbidities (such as chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, kidney disease, liver disease, Parkinson\\\\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, motor-neuron disease) should be prioritized for early vaccination and management of their co-morbidities. People living with HIV should not be excluded from COVID-19 vaccine access plans regardless of their immune status, and countries should include people living with HIV as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination according to their epidemiological context.\"], \"context\": []}, {\"tag\": \"tag#110\", \"patterns\": [\"\\\\r\\\\n                                        What can WHO and the world do to support people living with HIV to live a healthy life?\\\\r\\\\n                                    \", \"(\\'what can you do to help hiv people?\\', 147)\", \"(\\'what can who do to make people living with hiv feel good and able to live a healthy life?\\', 121)\", \"(\\'what can the world do to support people living with hiv?\\', 119)\", \"(\\'what should who do to help people living with hiv live a healthy life?\\', 112)\", \"(\\'what can who do for people living with hiv to live a healthy life?\\', 110)\", \"(\\'show the steps that who and others will take to help people living with hiv live a healthy life?\\', 108)\", \"(\\'show what can help people living with hiv live a healthier more happy and more independent life?\\', 84)\", \"(\\'show the steps that people who live with hiv and others will take to help them live a healthy life?\\', 59)\", \"(\\'show the steps that will be taken by those living with hiv to live a healthy life? 108\\', 44)\", \"(\\'show the steps people and others are going to take to help people living with hiv to live a healthy life?\\', 40)\", \"(\\'show the steps that we and others will take to help people living with hiv live a healthy life?\\', 20)\", \"(\\'show the steps that who and others will take to help people living with hiv live a healthy life?\\', 18)\", \"(\\'show the steps that who and others will take to help people living with hiv have a healthy life? 108\\', 16)\", \"(\\'show the steps that who and others will take to help people living with hiv live a healthy life? 108\\', 14)\"], \"responses\": [\"\\\\nWhile WHO is working with countries to ensure fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to continue actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to reduce COVID-19 deaths.

WHO definitions of a contact of a COVID-19 case can be found\\\\u00a0\\\\r\\\\n    here. Examples of contacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-face or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter with the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids\\\\r\\\\n        without adequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the same working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living in the same household as a confirmed case.WHO recommends\\\\u00a0that contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last point of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had\\\\r\\\\n    close contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and practice physical distancing.

Probably the most up-to-date summary of scientific information we have on survival in the environment is from the European Centre for Disease control (ECDC) and the following is extracted from their recent\\\\u00a0technical report:Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3]. These findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. Moreover, different levels of environmental contamination have been detected in rooms of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 1 out of 13 to 13 out of 15 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 before cleaning. No air samples were positive in these studies, but one sample from an air exhaust outlet was positive indicating that virus particles may be displaced by air and deposited on surfaces [4,5]. In a study of environmental contamination in a Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU), the COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated isolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self-service printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams, desktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves (15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6]. This evidence shows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, therefore reinforcing the belief that fomites play a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the relative importance of this route of transmission compared to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still unclear.\"], \"context\": []}, {\"tag\": \"tag#153\", \"patterns\": [\"\\\\r\\\\n                                        What measures should be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?\\\\r\\\\n                                    \", \"(\\'how is the pandemic affecting food supply and consumption?\\', 144)\", \"(\\'tell me the best way to ensure safe transportation of food during pandemic?\\', 117)\", \"(\\'how can we ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?\\', 114)\", \"(\\'what measures are possible to ensure safe transport of food during the pandemic?\\', 104)\", \"(\\'what must be done to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?\\', 104)\", \"(\\'what actions must be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?\\', 100)\", \"(\\'recommend some measures that can be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?\\', 96)\", \"(\\'what steps should be taken to ensure safe transport of food during the pandemic?\\', 96)\", \"(\\'what measures should be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?\\', 88)\", \"(\\'how can we ensure a safe transport of food during the pandemic?

However, there\\\\r\\\\n    is evolving and conflicting evidence whether people living with HIV have an increased risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 clinical complications in PLHIV compared to the general population. PLHIV can have a greater prevalence of the known risk factors for COVID-19 acquisition and complications, such as heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, obesity, as well as, other comorbidities and co-infections, like tuberculosis.\\\\u00a0Several case report series and small cohort studies among hospitalized PLHIV with COVID-19 have shown comparable clinical outcomes and similar risk of SARS CoV2 infection when compared with general population, particularly in those with well controlled HIV infection (on ART and with a CD4 count > 200 cells/mm3 and suppressed viral load). These limited clinical data suggest the mortality risk in PLHIV is associated with known COVID-19 factors such as older age and presence of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and obesity [1-3].There have been several systematic and non-systematic reviews that evaluated COVID-19 outcomes among PLHIV; most have found comparable outcomes of mortality and morbidity when compared with HIV negative patients [4-8]. Methods did not always include assessment of outcomes while controlling for known COVID-19 risk factors [4]. There is also limited data in patients with advanced HIV disease (i.e. low CD4 cell count).\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0One systematic review, notably published as a pre-print, found of 144,795 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in North America, Europe, and Asia the pooled prevalence of HIV in COVID-19 patients was 1.22% [95% (CI): 0.61%-2.43%)] translating to a 2-fold increase compared to the respective local-level pooled HIV prevalence in the general population of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.48%-0.89%) \\\\u2013 which hinted at a potential susceptibility among PLHIV [9].\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0Additional data on this topic come from several cohort studies from South Africa, the USA and the UK [10-12] have reported a moderate increased risk of death directly attributed to HIV infection after adjustments for age, sex, ethnicity and presence of\\\\r\\\\n    comorbidities; an unpublished meta-analysis including these studies found that the risk of death was almost double that of HIV-negative patients; however, confounding by comorbidities associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 cannot be ruled\\\\r\\\\n    out [13].\\\\u00a0Protecting people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensuring they can maintain treatment, is critical. Researchers are currently investigating whether people with HIV have an increased risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19. Preliminary\\\\r\\\\n        evidence of moderate increased vulnerability of people with HIV makes it even more urgent that people with HIV have access to ARVs and treatments for co-morbidities \\\\u2013 such as treatment for hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary\\\\r\\\\n        disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, and maintenance of a healthy body weight.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0A larger dataset from a broader geographical representation is required to expand understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with HIV impacts the severity of illness, disease progression and outcomes from hospitalization with COVID-19. For this purpose, WHO has established a Global COVID-19 Clinical Platform. As of 4 November 2020, WHO has received clinical data from 79 000 patients hospitalised with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including from 5 291 hospitalised patients living with HIV, from over 30 countries around the world. The platform is open to all Member States and health facilities to contribute data and inclusion will help inform future guidance on how best to ensure PLHIV are well protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.PLHIV are advised to take the same COVID-19 precautions as recommended for the general population [14-15]: wash hands often; practice cough etiquette; ensure physical distancing; wear masks when appropriate and according to local regulations; seek medical care if symptomatic; self-isolate if one develops symptoms or has contact with a positive \\\\u00a0COVID-19 case; and other actions per the local and government response.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0It is important to ensure that PLHIV have access to antiretroviral drugs for longer periods (3-6 month supply); and that programmes practice multi-month dispensing (MMD) of ARVs, as well as, other necessary medications, such as, opiate substitution therapy (OST), TB preventative therapy (TPT) and treatments for comorbidities.

Published data indicate that most of patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, have good clinical outcomes and do not require hospitalization. In some cases, patients admitted to the hospital were given an antiretroviral drug, most often lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r) or, less frequently, darunavir boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r). Studies assessing the potential benefit of an antiretroviral drug on COVID-19 were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals. A systematic review on use of antiretrovirals in patients with coronaviruses, conducted in March 2020 identified two randomized trials and 21 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID\\\\u201019, SARS and MERS [16]. The randomized trials showed no clinical benefit, the observational studies were inconclusive, and the certainty of the body of evidence across all important outcomes was low or very low quality. A living systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of drug treatments for COVID-19 published in September 2020 did not find any convincing evidence that antiretrovirals drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir reduced the mortality or increased the rate of viral clearance [17].More recently, two additional randomized studies confirmed these findings and didn\\'t support the use of LPV/r for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.A recently published clinical trial showed that in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, LPV/r was not associated with reductions in mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death [18].\\\\u00a0 Similarly, in the WHO-coordinated Solidarity Trial recently published, LPV/r appears to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. [19].Based on available evidence, the use of LPV/r and other antiretrovirals are not likely to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19.Several randomized and nonrandomized studies have evaluated anti-hepatitis C drugs including sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for treating of SARS-CoV-2 and while these preliminary results suggested benefit in terms of clinical recovery, this evidence is insufficient (small sample size, inclusion of a nonrandomized study) to be able to recommend using these antivirals for treating SARS-CoV-2.

These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services \\\\u2013 and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation.It is WHO\\\\u2019s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19.If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment.\"], \"context\": []}, {\"tag\": \"tag#261\", \"patterns\": [\"\\\\r\\\\n                                        What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?\\\\r\\\\n                                    \", \"(\\'how should health authorities and organizers evaluate risks?\\', 161)\", \"(\\'what factors should the organizers look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?\\', 115)\", \"(\\'list the main factors organizers and health authorities should look at when evaluating whether the risks are acceptable or not?\\', 110)\", \"(\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when evaluating whether the risks are acceptable or not?\\', 95)\", \"(\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?\\', 88)\", \"(\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not? \\', 87)\", \"(\\\\\"show the factors organizers and health authorities look at when determining whether the risks are acceptable or not? \\'\\'\\\\\", 31)\", \"(\\\\\"list the important factors that should organizers and health authorities look at in assessing whether risks are acceptable or not? \\'\\\\\", 31)\", \"(\\\\\"\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether risks are acceptable? \\'\\\\\", 26)\", \"(\\\\\"\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when evaluating whether the risks are acceptable or not?\\\\\", 24)\", \"(\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether risks are acceptable or not?\\', 22)\", \"(\\\\\"\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether risks are acceptable or not?\\\\\", 21)\", \"(\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?\\', 18)\", \"(\\\\\"what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not? \\'\\'\\\\\", 16)\", \"(\\\\\"\\'what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not? \\'\\\\\", 15)\", \"(\\\\\"what factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not? \\'\\' 87\\\\\", 14)\"], \"responses\": [\"\\\\nFor countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020.

Special provisions should be considered for early childhood development, higher learning institutions, residential schools or specialized institutions.WHO recommends the following:Community-level measures: Carry out early detection, testing, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts; investigate clusters; ensure physical distancing, hand and hygiene practices and age-appropriate mask use; shield vulnerable groups. Community-led initiatives such as addressing misleading rumors also play an important role in reducing the risk of infection.Policy, practice and infrastructure: Ensure the necessary resources, policies and infrastructure, are in place that protect the health and safety of all school personnel, including people at higher risk.Behavioral aspects: Consider the age and capacity of students to understand and respect measures put in place. Younger children may find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing or the appropriate use of masks.Safety and security: School closure or re-opening may affect the safety and security of students and the most vulnerable children may require special attention, such as during pick-up and drop-off.Hygiene and daily practices at the school and classroom level: Physical distancing of at least 1 metre between individuals including spacing of desks, frequent hand and respiratory hygiene, age-appropriate mask use, ventilation and environmental cleaning measures should be in place to limit exposure. Schools should educate staff and students on COVID-19 prevention measures, develop a schedule for daily cleaning and disinfection of the school environment, facilities and frequently touches surfaces, and ensure availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks.Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff: Schools should enforce the policy of \\\\u201cstaying home if unwell\\\\u201d, waive the requirement for a doctor\\\\u2019s note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), ensure students who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case stay home for 14 days, and consider options for screening on arrival.Protection of individuals at high-risk: Schools should identify students and teachers at high-risk with pre-existing medical conditions to come up with strategies to keep them safe; maintain physical distancing and se of medical masks as well as frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.Communication with parents and students: Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support.Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes: Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support.Physical distancing outside classrooms: Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre for both students (all age groups) and staff, where feasible.Physical distancing inside classrooms:In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, maintain a distance of at least 1 metre between all individuals of all age groups, for any schools remaining open. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunchbreaks; limiting the mixing of classes and of age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms.In areas with cluster-transmission of COVID-19, a risk-based approach should be taken when deciding whether to keep a distance of at least 1 metre between students. Staff should always keep at least 1 metre apart from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical.In areas with sporadic cases/no cases of COVID-19, children under the age of 12 should not be required to keep physical distance at all times. Where feasible, children aged 12 and over should keep at least 1 metre apart from each other. \\\\u00a0Staff should always keep at least 1 metre from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical.  Remote learning: Where children cannot attend classes in person, support should be given to ensure students have continued access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television), (e.g. delivering assignments or broadcasting lessons).

COVID-19 and influenza spread in similar ways. Both COVID-19 and influenza are spread by droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings or breathes. The droplets and aerosols can land in the eyes, nose or mouth of people who are nearby -- typically within 1 metre of the infected person, but sometimes even further away. People can also get infected with both COVID-19 and influenza by touching contaminated surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a03. Some of the same groups have a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and influenza. While all age groups can be infected with both the COVID-19 virus and influenza virus, these people are at higher risk for severe disease and death from both COVID-19 and influenza:Healthcare workers are at high risk of getting infected by COVID-19 and at high risk of getting infected by influenza. Pregnant people and those who have recently given birth are at high risk for experiencing severe influenza and severe COVID-19. \\\\u00a04.

To protect against COVID-19 and influenza, follow these public health and social measures:Vaccination is an important part of preventing severe disease and death for both COVID-19 and influenza. Follow the advice of your local authorities on getting the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. WHO recommends the influenza vaccine for older individuals, young children, pregnant people, people with underlying health conditions, and health workers. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for most people 18 years and older, including those with pre-existing conditions of any kind, including auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as chronic infections that are stable and controlled. If supplies are limited in your area, discuss your situation with your care provider if you:People with mild symptoms of both COVID-19 and influenza can usually be cared for safely at home. For more information about caring for someone safely at home with COVID-19, watch this episode of Science in 5. 5. There are safe and effective vaccines for both COVID-19 and influenza. COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to protect against severe illness and death caused by COVID-19 disease. Millions of people around the world have safely received COVID-19 vaccines, and the vaccines have met rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. Getting vaccinated may also protect the people around you. If you are protected from getting COVID-19, you are less likely to infect someone else. COVID-19 vaccines do not protect against influenza.WHO recommends vaccinations each year to prevent severe influenza disease in high-risk groups: pregnant people, individuals with underlying health conditions, older adults, health workers, and young children.\\\\u00a0\"], \"context\": []}, {\"tag\": \"tag#321\", \"patterns\": [\"\\\\r\\\\n                                        How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?\\\\r\\\\n                                    \", \"(\\'how is the covid-19 virus different from the influenza virus?\\', 103)\", \"(\\'how different is covid-19 and influenza viruses??\\', 102)\", \"(\\'how different is the virus covid-19 from the virus influenza? 102\\', 45)\", \"(\\'how different is covid-19 and the influenza virus?\\', 25)\", \"(\\'how different is covid-19 and the influenza viruses?\\', 23)\", \"(\\'how different is the covid-19 and influenza viruses??\\', 22)\"], \"responses\": [\"\\\\n1.

This will help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach those in need as soon as they are available.WHO advises every country to develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for COVID-19 vaccines.\\\\u00a0 Having one plan in each country, that comprehensively describes all elements of the country\\\\u2019s approach to COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be crucial for a coordinated effort.\\\\u00a0Guidance on developing that plan\\\\u00a0is available from WHO, including all elements that a country needs to consider.\"], \"context\": []}, {\"tag\": \"tag#386\", \"patterns\": [\"\\\\r\\\\n                                        How is the research and development process being accelerated without compromising safety?\\\\r\\\\n                                    \", \"(\\'how do we accelerate the rd process without compromising safety?\\', 130)\", \"(\\'how can one accelerate research development without compromising safety?\\', 122)\", \"(\\'how can a rf process be accelerated without compromising safety?\\', 118)\", \"(\\'how can we accelerate research and development without compromising safety?\\', 118)\", \"(\\'how are the research and development process accelerated without compromising safety?\\', 97)\", \"(\\'can you list the best ways to accelerate the research and development process?\\', 75)\", \"(\\\\\"\\'how can a researcher achieve the goal of accelerating the research process without compromising safety? 97\\\\\", 56)\", \"(\\'how can the research and development process be accelerated without risking the safety of the product? 97\\', 46)\", \"(\\'can you list the ways to accelerate the research and development process without compromising safety?\\', 43)\", \"(\\'how can a research process be accelerated without compromising safety? 97 \\', 40)\", \"(\\'how can the research and development process be accelerated with minimal risk? 97\\', 39)\", \"(\\'how do you accelerate your research and development process without compromising safety?\\', 39)\", \"(\\'how do you speed up the research and development process without compromising safety?\\', 35)\", \"(\\'how are research and development processes accelerated without compromising safety?\\', 23)\", \"(\\'how can the research and development process be accelerated without compromising safety? 97\\', 20)\"], \"responses\": [\"\\\\nWHO and its partners are committed to accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines while maintaining the highest standards on safety.Vaccines go through various phases of development and testing \\\\u2013 there are usually three  phases to clinical trials, with the last one designed to assess the ability of  the product to protect against disease, which is called efficacy.

This means that some of the steps in the research and development process have been happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time. It is the scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous.The more vaccines in development the more opportunities there are for success.

The current primary goal of immunization in the COVID-19 pandemic remains to protect people against hospitalization, severe disease and death. Hence, booster doses may only be needed if there is evidence of insufficient protection against these disease outcomes over time. More data are needed to understand how the protection we get from vaccines changes over time. It is likely that this will be different for different vaccines, populations, virus variants circulating in an area and how likely a person is to be exposed to the virus. At present, there is not enough supply of COVID-19 vaccines to vaccinate all high priority groups against COVID-19.

Myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many factors, including infections, viruses, medicines and environmental factors.

There have been reports of very rare but serious cases of blood clots accompanied by low platelet counts (known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)) occurring 3 to 30 days after vaccination with COVID-19 non-replicant adenovirus vector-based vaccines (such as the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines). Read more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines. With the AstraZeneca vaccine, as of 15 July 2021, the data shows that these symptoms occur in about four to six people out of every million vaccinated (this figure varies based on age, sex and geographical location)[2}. Younger adults appear to be at higher risk than older adults. More research is underway to understand more about how people may be differently affected. With the Janssen vaccine, as of the 7 May 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed 28 reports of TTS out of a total of more than eight million people vaccinated[3]. It is possible that that there a causal link between the vaccine and these symptoms, but more data is needed. TTS is very rare; however, blood clotting is a common health problem caused by many factors. Not all clots that occur after vaccination with Astra Zeneca or the Janssen vaccine will be due to TTS. The risk of blood clots is far higher from COVID-19 itself than from either vaccine. If you experience a new, severe, persistent headache, blurred vision, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, leg swelling or unusual skin bruising and shortness of breath between three to 30 days following vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. WHO has published interim guidance for clinical case management of TTS following vaccination.

For the Janssen vaccine, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reported that 100 cases of Guillain-Barr\\\\u00e9 syndrome had been reported through the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in the United States of America (USA) as of 30 June, with approximately 12.2 million doses of the Janssen vaccine administered. Outside of the European Union and the USA, cases of Guillain-Barr\\\\u00e9 syndrome have also been reported; however further investigation is needed to determine whether the rate has increased from usual levels. Guillain-Barr\\\\u00e9 syndrome has many causes, such as bacterial or viral infections, surgery or vaccine administration. It can also be caused by COVID-19. In 2011, it was estimated that the incidence of Guillain-Barr\\\\u00e9 syndrome in Europe and Northern America was 0.8 to 1.9 cases out of every 100 000 people [4].

Models are subject to trade-offs, not least, the balance between comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. WHO\\\\u2019s estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also approximations in a rapidly evolving pandemic with regard to transmissibility and severity. It is worth noting that WHO relies on models to compile a wide range of global health statistics. This is necessary as not all countries have high quality information systems, or those that do cannot always share their data in a timely manner. Therefore, WHO works with countries to strengthen their data and health information systems, while at the same time makes the best use of the data currently available to generate high quality evidence.\\\\u00a0Specifically with regard to the excess mortality estimates, the model uses relationships that have been quantified using data from the countries with high quality systems for data reporting. We extrapolate these relationships to settings that are in many ways systematically different across multiple dimensions such as health systems capacity, underlying disease burden and age-structure. Countries have differed on when they experienced waves and how they responded, and quantifying this temporal relationships between COVID-19 surges or the effects of the emergence of variants is not trivial. In some settings the country responses were reactive but in many others they were proactive. As such, despite the effort to calibrate the model such that it is accurate in different settings, one of the more important limitations to note is that the input data have limited representation and this model generalizes the covariate relationships quantified to settings that may be systematically different from those observed. The final model is intentionally parsimonious. This reduction in complexity means it is not possible for such a reduced set of variables to explain all of the variation that is observed across countries. While the variables chosen are contextually relevant and are found to explain a significant component of the variation in excess, the underlying population characteristics that drove these differences are too complex to fully capture perfectly in a single global model and, hence, the trade-offs referred to above have had to be made. The estimates, therefore, are the best possible at this point in time for the first 18 months of the pandemic and have some degree of uncertainty around them.\\\\u00a0\"], \"context\": []}, {\"tag\": \"tag#503\", \"patterns\": [\"\\\\r\\\\n                                        What are the next steps?\\\\r\\\\n                                    \", \"(\\'what should i do next?\\', 101)\", \"(\\'what should next be next?\\', 99)\", \"(\\'tell me the next step?\\', 94)\", \"(\\'what are next steps for you?\\', 91)\", \"(\\'what are the next steps?\\', 88)\", \"(\\'what next step should we take?\\', 32)\", \"(\\'what will be the next step in this process?\\', 31)\", \"(\\'how do i go about this? 88 \\', 30)\", \"(\\\\\"what\\'s the next step?\\\\\", 22)\", \"(\\'what are the next steps?\\', 17)\", \"(\\\\\"\\'what are your next steps?\\' 88\\\\\", 16)\", \"(\\'what are the next steps? 88\\', 14)\", \"(\\\\\"\\'what are the next steps?\\' 88\\\\\", 12)\"], \"responses\": [\"\\\\nThe country consultation closed in November 2021.
